Focus on NYC Airbnb data.

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>%
  select(borough = neighbourhood_group,
         neighbourhood, stars, price, room_type, lat, long) %>%
  drop_na(stars) %>%
  filter(
    borough == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500
  )
```

Let's make a scatterplot!

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, color= ~price,
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
```
